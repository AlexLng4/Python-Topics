#The list.sort method sorts a list in-place, that is, without making a copy. It returns
#None to remind us that it changes the target object, and does not create a new list. This
#is an important Python API convention: functions or methods that change an object
#in-place should return None to make it clear to the caller that the object itself was
#changed, and no new object was created. The same behavior can be seen, for example,
#in the random.shuffle function
